RFM Analysis: Overview RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:

recency (the date they made their last purchase)
frequency (how often they make purchases)
monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
